# Daily-Quotes-App-Flutter-
Description: Create a basic mobile app that displays a new inspirational quote to users
every day.
Features you can include:
1)Quote Display: The main screen of the app will show the daily inspirational quote.
Users can tap a button to refresh and get a new quote each day.
2)Random Quotes API: Utilize a public API that provides random quotes. For example,
the "They Said So" Quotes API is a free and easy-to-use option.
3)Simple User Interface: Design a clean and straightforward user interface with a large
"Refresh" button to fetch new quotes. Include a space to display the quote text and the
author's name.
4)Minimal Navigation: Keep the app navigation minimal, focusing on just the main
screen with the quote. No need for complex menus or additional screens.
5)Save Favorites: Add a feature that allows users to mark certain quotes as favorites.
These favorites could be saved locally on the device.
6)Share Quotes: Implement a basic sharing feature that lets users share a quote through
messaging or social media apps.
